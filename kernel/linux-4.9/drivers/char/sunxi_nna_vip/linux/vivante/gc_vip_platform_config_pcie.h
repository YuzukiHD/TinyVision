The base address of VIP SRAM.
VIP SRAM is a SRAM inside VIP core. It needs to be mapped to a 32 bits address space.
The VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS is a base address for mapping VIP SRAM, so the VIP SRAM has been mapped to
[VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS ~~ VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS + VIP_SRAM_SIZE] range.
After this mapping, VIP core access VIP SRAM through
VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS ~~ VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS+VIP_SRAM_SIZE address range.
Actually, The value of VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS may not be on DRAM.

How to config the VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS?
1. It can only be a 32bits value.
2. can't be config to zero.
3. It can't be configured to be close to 4Gbytes value.
   (VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS+vip_sram_size) can't be close to 4Gbytes.
4. It should be align to 64bytes.
5. can't be overlap with video memory range.

example:

The size of DRAM is 1G bytes. So DRAM memory address range is [0 ~~ 0x40000000].
In this case, you can set the value of vip_sram_address to 0x50000000. 0x50000000 is outside of DRAM.
0x50000000 is not a real physical address on SRAM.

If you need to specify address for VIP-SRAM, this value can be outside the range of video memory.
The address shoule be aligned to 64byte.

don't need configure VIP_SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS if set vpmdENABLE_MMU to 1.
Because driver will reserved memory space for VIP-SRAM in MMU page table.
We recomment that remap VIP-SRAM base address to 0x400000 when MMU is disabled.
