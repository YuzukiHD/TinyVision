config AW_SPINAND_PHYSICAL_LAYER
	bool
	help
	  Enable support for Allwinner's physical layer for spinand.
	  It's a command physical layer, used by both AW-nand with nftl and
	  MTD-nand with ubi.

config AW_SPINAND_SECURE_STORAGE
	bool
	help
	  Enable secure storage for Allwinner's spinand.

	  If unsure, say no.

	select MTD_PSTORE
	help
	  Whether create pstore mtd partition, which is need by pstroe-blk.
	  If you want linux kernel dump log to spinand when oops/panic, you
	  should create pstreo mtd partition by this configure.

	  If unsure, say no.

config AW_SPINAND_ENABLE_PHY_CRC16
	bool "check crc16 for each page on spinand physical layer"

	  It is experimental.
	  To check crc16 for each page on spinand physical layer.

	  If unsure, say no.

	default y
	help
	  spinand do not support multiplane. In order to adapt to aw nand
	  we simulate multiplane. If set, the common physical layer should
	  merge two continuous physical block to 'super block' for logical
	  layer.

	  Merge pages in two adjacent blocks with the same page num to super
	  page. Merge adjacent blocks to super block.

		aw spinand do not support read raw spare data by default, say yes to
		support mtd read oob raw spare data.

		if enable AW_MTD_SPINAND_OOB_RAW_SPARE, the oob is equivalent to spare area,
